# If Chinese Insurance Stocks comprise 3.5% of all Insurance securities (globally),
# approximately how many Insurance bonds are Chinese?
# Required to answer. Single choice.
bonds = 33000
chinese_insurance_all = 36000 * 1000

chinese_bonds = chinese_insurance_all * 0.265
print(chinese_bonds)
# Chinese Insurance Stocks comprise 3.5% of all Insurance securities, which leaves 26.5% of
# Chinese bonds.
# The total number of Insurance securities is: 33,000,000+3,000,000= 36,000,000.
# Now we only need to calculate 26.5% of 36,000,000:
# (36,000,000 *0.265)= 9,540,000, which is approximately 9,500,000
# The answer is B- 9,500,000.
