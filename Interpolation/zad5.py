# In percentages, how much more USD will one get when exchanging 1,223,500 JPY
# compared to exchanging 9,750 EUR?Required to answer. Single choice.
usd_jpy = 1223500 * 0.013
usd_eur = 9750 * 1.4401
increase = usd_jpy - usd_eur
percent = increase / usd_eur * 100

# Examples - Percentage Increase and Decrease
# In January Dylan worked a total of 35 hours, in February he worked 45.5 hours – by what percentage did Dylan’s working hours increase in February?
#
# To tackle this problem first we calculate the difference in hours between the new and old numbers.  45.5 - 35 hours = 10.5 hours.  We can see that Dylan worked 10.5 hours more in February than he did in January – this is his increase.  To work out the increase as a percentage it is now necessary to divide the increase by the original (January) number:
#
# 10.5 ÷ 35 = 0.3  (See our division page for instruction and examples of division.)
#
# Finally, to get the percentage we multiply the answer by 100.  This simply means moving the decimal place two columns to the right.
#
# 0.3 × 100 = 30
#
# Dylan therefore worked 30% more hours in February than he did in January.
#
# In March Dylan worked 35 hours again – the same as he did in January (or 100% of his January hours).  What is the percentage difference between Dylan’s February hours (45.5) and his March hours (35)?
#
# First calculate the decrease in hours, that is: 45.5 - 35 = 10.5
#
# Then divide the decrease by the original number (February hours) so:
#
# 10.5 ÷ 45.5 = 0.23 (to two decimal places).
#
# Finally multiply 0.23 by 100 to give 23%. Dylan’s hours were 23% lower in March than in February.
