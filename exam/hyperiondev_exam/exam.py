# # You are going to be creating a program that represents the movements of the line for the lady's bathroom.
# # To begin, create a list that represents the line, it must contain the five names of the women initially waiting (you can make these up).
# #
# # The following events occur, and you must represent them in the list and print the list out after each action.
# #
# # A woman named Jenny arrives who only wanted to check her lipstick, she asks to join the front of the line,
# # and all the women let her.
# # The woman third in lineâ€™s phone started ringing, and she left the line to answer.
# # A new woman named Alice joined the line.
# # Use the trinket IDE below to write and test your code.
